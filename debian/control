Description: Active Directory information dumper via LDAP (Python 3)
 This package contains an Active Directory information dumper via LDAP. In an
 Active Directory domain, a lot of interesting information can be retrieved via
 LDAP by any authenticated user (or machine). This makes LDAP an interesting
 protocol for gathering information in the recon phase of a pentest of an
 internal network. A problem is that data from LDAP often is not available in
 an easy to read format.
 .
 ldapdomaindump is a tool which aims to solve this problem, by collecting and
 parsing information available via LDAP and outputting it in a human readable
 HTML format, as well as machine readable json and csv/tsv/greppable files.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
